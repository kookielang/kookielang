# Kookie Language Design

Welcome to the official repo for Kookie language design. This is where new Kookie language features are developed, adopted and specified.

If you discover bugs or deficiencies in the above, please leave an issue to raise them, or even better: a pull request to fix them.<br>

For new feature proposals, however, please raise them for [discussion](https://github.com/kookielang/kookielang/labels/discussion), and only submit a proposal as a pull request if invited to do so by an organization member.
